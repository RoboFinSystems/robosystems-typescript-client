# Curated release notes

`tag-release.yml` generates the GitHub release body from a Claude-written
changelog of the changes since the last tag. That framing suits routine
releases but reads poorly for a milestone, where the story is what the version
_is_ rather than what changed since last Tuesday.

To override it, commit the notes here as `v<version>.md` **before** dispatching
`create-release.yml`. The file has to exist at the tagged ref, so it belongs in
release prep alongside the version bump — not added afterwards. When the file is
present the workflow uses it verbatim and skips the generated changelog, the
release-statistics section, and the generated-with footer.

No file, no change: the release falls back to the generated changelog. Skipping
a release is a normal outcome, not a failure.

## Writing a new one

Write the body only. The workflow supplies the `# RoboSystems TypeScript SDK
v<version>` heading and the links section, so don't repeat them here — start at
the first line of prose.

The filename is version-specific on purpose: a leftover file can never be picked
up by a later release.

For this SDK, curated notes are **mandatory for majors and for any minor that
deprecates surface** — post-1.0, those notes are the compatibility contract:
they list what changed in the public surface, what is deprecated (and its
earliest removal major), and what was removed.
